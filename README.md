# Introduction

League of Legends is a PC game developed by the company Riot Games.  It is the most widely-played PC game in the world, with an estimated 100 million active players each month.  The mechanics of the game are not essential to the project, but some explanation is merited: a match in League of Legends pits five players (called "summoners") against five others, each controlling a unique character ("champion") with the goal of destroying the opposing teams "nexus".  The popularity of the game stems from its extremely deep gameplay mechanics, which in turn make each individual match contain a lot of interesting data within.  

I chose the League of Legends API for three reasons.  Firstly, I have been meaning to do a project with the League of Legends API for several months now, and this seemed like the perfect opportunity to get started.  Secondly, I have a passion for the world of eSports, and wanted that enthusiasm to help drive my enthusiasm for this project.  Lastly, there's a ton of interesting things about the League of Legends API - both in the sense that it produces interesting insights into the game, and the task of finding those insights produces interesting scientific and engineering challenges.
